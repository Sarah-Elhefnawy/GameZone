# GameZone
The "GameZone" project is a robust ASP.NET MVC Core application that showcases seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is inspired by the fantastic work of passionate developers like Muhammad Elhelaly, who has created a series of tutorial videos on the topic.

## Project Overview

-  Add new games to the database
-  Edit existing game details
-  Delete games from the system

## Key Features

**-  Dual Game Listing Views:**
<br>
The application provides two different views for displaying the available games - a grid-like layout and a more detailed view with additional information about each game.
<br>
**-  CRUD Operations:**
<br>
The project implements full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete game entries in the database.
<br>
**-  Form Validation:**
<br>
The application includes client-side and server-side validation to ensure that the user input for creating or updating a game is valid.
<br>
**-  Responsive Design:**
<br>
The project is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
